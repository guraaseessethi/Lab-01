        <h1><u><i>In the life of Guraasees Sethi</i></u></h1>
        <p>
            Was born in <b>2002</b>, Lived in a small town <b>Ludhiana</b> in <b>India</b>,<br>
            then moved out of my house and trying to start a new phase of my life in <b>Canada</b> by <br>
            studying a stream which <em>I have a keen interest in.</em>
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I completed in my high school from <b>Bal Bharati Public School</b> i don't know why they have <br>
            written public in there name but it is a private school in India. After completeing my studies from
            there<br>
            which was in 2020 <i>Covid</i> came and boy that was a nightmare. I had to live in my house for like 2 years
            doing nothing,<br>
            Actually i did attend a University in India but was liking it that much so I dropped ou and now I'm studing
            <b>Georgian College</b><br>
            which I'm liking so far cause I'm finally getting that independence and the college life I was craving for
            so long. <br>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            My goal is basically to complete my studies. After my PG i wanna complete my degree after getting a few years of experiance
            <br>in this field and then do Masters in business and maybe start my own company after that.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            I had a few achivements in the field of sports. I played Volleyball, Table Tennis and Badminton for the school,
            <br> I also had a few open competiton in swimming as well. But my greatest achivement was to get out of 
            <br>depression and very proud of that, I mean that shit took my confidence, my friends, my social life and <br>
            I finally got rid of it.
